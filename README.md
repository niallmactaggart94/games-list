# Game Store Inventory

You have been tasked with building an inventory system for a local video game store.

The owner of the store has asked you to build a system that will allow them to list games that are for sale and allow customers to browse the listings.

## Your solution should consist of:
- A web UI (for example a react application)
- A backend API to persist and retrieve data (for example a Java service)

A list of games has been provided for you in JSON format. Please use this as your data source for the API.

## The core functionality the system should have is:

- A view that shows a list of the available games
- A detailed view for each game.
    - Users should be able to navigate to the detail view from the list view

*Please provide a small README along with your finished code to let us know how to run your solution locally.*

## Stretch Tasks

If you have extra time you might want to consider adding extra functionality, for example adding the ability to add new games to the store.
